# VÄ±rtual ID
Arduino UNO(C++) and Autocad

This personal project was developed against identity theft. 
Those whose identity is stolen will secure their information thanks to their fingerprints.
How to use?
1. Set up the circuit given in Fritzing(.fzz)
2. Run Enrolling fingerprint.ino through Arduino IDE while your Arduino UNO was plugged and follow instructions displayed in the LCD display(or serial monitor).
3. Write your ID informations into required place where it says "Name, ID, Class and DOB" in the Fingerprint Dettection.ino.
4. Finally, run Fingerprint Dettection.ino and again follow instructions displayed in the LCD display. Also, registered fingerprint can be deleted through Deleting fingerprints.ino in the same way. Moreover, 3D modelling of this project created in Autocad can be inspected.
